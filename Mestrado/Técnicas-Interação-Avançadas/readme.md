## Técnicas de Interação Avançadas

###1516-horrorgame #malayka66 
A group project which is a horror game with an imersive environment made in Unity. 

There are two players. 
The player 1 is inside the game (experienced by DIVE) that needs to scape from hospital. However he needs to get the keys to open the door and be very strong (!), because each time he gets scared he's providing more points to player 2. 

The player 2 can manipulate monsters and other scary things inside the map through points. His objective is scare the player 1 to death and try to gain more points, by scaring him during the game.

Made with 4 main components:
- BITalino: to track BPM values that gives the "scary points"
- Kinect: each time player 1 makes a step he walks inside the game
- Interactive Table: with a web application, player 2 can interact with the game through the table, dragging elements to the the map
- Dive (VR): creates an imersive environment
